# flatiron-react-phase-2-project-frontend

This is my phase 2 react project, inspired by my cousin's wedding that is coming up. I wanted to recreate a wedding page, that included a homepage, an rsvp page and a message board page. The RSVP page will have a form where the guests can fill out their information and select their dinner choice. They also have the option to leave a message for the lovely couple, which will then be displayed in the "Messages" page. The Bride and Groom will be able to read the lovely and heartfelt messages from their guests and loved ones on the message board.
